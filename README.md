# 🚨 Route Optimization for Emergency Services Using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

This project applies the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm to simulate and optimize the routing of emergency services (ambulances, fire trucks, police units) in an urban road network. Inspired by the natural behavior of ants, ACO provides an adaptive and efficient approach to solving the shortest path problem in dynamic environments.

## 📌 Project Objective

To minimize the response time of emergency vehicles by identifying the most optimal route in real-time using bio-inspired algorithms.

## 📚 Background

Traditional routing algorithms like Dijkstra’s or A* work well in static environments but often fall short in real-time or dynamic traffic conditions. Ant Colony Optimization mimics the behavior of ants laying down pheromone trails to discover the shortest path, making it suitable for adaptive and decentralized routing.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

- **Urban Road Network Simulation**: Models roads and intersections with distances and traffic data.
- **Emergency Vehicle Data Handler**: Receives input such as type, urgency, source, and destination.
- **ACO Algorithm Core**: Simulates ant agents exploring multiple paths and updating pheromones.
- **Dynamic Route Selection Module**: Chooses optimal paths based on real-time feedback.
- **Navigation Interface**: Outputs the optimized route to emergency responders.

## 🧠 Algorithm

ACO involves:
- Initialization of pheromone levels
- Probabilistic route construction by artificial ants
- Pheromone update and evaporation
- Iterative improvement of solutions
